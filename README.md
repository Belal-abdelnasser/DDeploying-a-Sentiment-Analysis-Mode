# Deploying-a-Sentiment-Analysis-Mode
SageMaker deployment project! In this project I construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. You will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I deploy my model and construct a simple web app which interacts with the deployed model.
